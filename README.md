# Python-Meetup-API
Find_Meetup_Groups

Here, I have identified various Python meetup groups from cities of India, USA, UK, HK, TW and Australia by following below steps 
and writting python codes for same. 
1) Fetch information from meetup.com using the API they have provided 
2) Move the data into a DataFrame and Analyse it 
3) Find insights from the analysis and join the right meetup groups.
